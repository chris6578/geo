(this is a work in progress)

- Code formatting should follow PSR-2.
- Issues should include code and/or data to reproduce the issue.
- PR's for issues should include test(s) for issue.
- PR's should have adequate documentation (commit messages, comments, etc.) to readily convey what and/or why.  
- Code should attempt to follow [Object Calisthenics](http://www.xpteam.com/jeff/writings/objectcalisthenics.rtf) methodology.
